Pascal's Triangle
This project is part of the Technical Interview concept in the curriculum of Holberton School. The goal of this project is to implement a function that generates Pascal's triangle.

Algorithm
The Pascal's triangle is a triangle of numbers where each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. The triangle starts with a single number 1 at the top, and each subsequent row is constructed by adding two adjacent numbers from the row above. The triangle is symmetric.

Implementation Details
The implementation is done in Python programming language.

Tasks
0. Pascal's Triangle
File: 0-pascal_triangle.py
Function: def pascal_triangle(n):
This task requires the creation of a function pascal_triangle that takes an integer n as input and returns a list of lists representing Pascal's triangle of height n.

The following conditions apply:

Returns an empty list if n <= 0
n is always an integer
Example usage:
